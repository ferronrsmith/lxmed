See how exactly does LXDE determine which Category is item in, since it has more Categories defined.

Wish list: under "edit code manually", a feature I love, would you add some mechanism to see what other missing options are available?
I am always forgetting what they are and have to go look them up in other examples.
"Terminal=true" is the main one I have to always look up.  By nice if there was some kind of pop up or a help file pop up listing them.
I wonder if writing them in with their default would work.  Or writing them in as empty (Terminal=) would work.

I have been thinking about this.  I think it would be better to put in the option with the default (Terminal=false).
The reason for this is that is gives an example of both the value and the case.   For instance, is it "Terminal=yes" or "TERMINAL=1" or "Terminal=FALSE".
Stating the default removes the syntax doubt.
I am only planting the seeds here.  You are far more creative at this than me, so I will defer your judgement.  (I am sure you will AMAZE!)
